Neural Network, Backpropagation and Facerecognition
====================================================

The main method to start the networks. You have this possibilities.

    First step: Define the network. Type a number:
    [0] Build your own network
    [1] Logistic map function
    [2] OR
    [3] XOR
    [4] Face recognition

[1] Logistic map function
---------------------
The NN lerns Logistic Map and makes a 2D plot 

[2] OR
[3] XOR
---------------------
    The NN lerns OR, XOR and makes a 3D plot
    

[4] Face recognition
---------------------
    This code is loading face and nonface datas from the 'data' folder.
    The images are grey.
    The images are transformed to matrixes 19x19 pixel and then to a vector 1x361 [361 = 19x19]
    Next the faces and nonfaces are stacked in one list.
    This list is pushed to the backpropagation network.

    The calculation takes ~30 minutes.

--------------------------

    The vast majority of the NeuralNetwork.py code comes from a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqRUHEeiyCs
    The Coder name is Ryan Harris.
    I made some more comments and addet methods to make the code cleaner for me.

    

Installation
-------------
Linux:
git clone git@github.com:LNeural_Network_Backpropagation_Facerecognitionivruen/Neural_Network_and_Backpropagation.git
